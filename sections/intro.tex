I consider myself a novice trying to get out of Dunning-Kruger's Valley of Despair, an individual who is intellectually curious, passion-driven and eager to make meaningful impacts. I have been working in the industry for over 4 years, focusing on developing AI solutions for Key Information Extraction from business documents. However, my interest does not lie within said domains and I am open to any interesting topic/problem. I am looking for opportunities where I could stay current with the literature, develope and implement AI solutions that people enjoy using.
