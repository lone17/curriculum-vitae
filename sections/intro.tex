I consider myself a novice trying to get out of Dunning-Kruger's Valley of Despair, an individual who is intellectually curious and passionate about making even the slightest meaningful impact. I have been working in the industry for four years, focusing on Information Extraction on business documents using techniques from Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. However, my research interest does not lie within said domains. I am open to any interesting topic as I am driven by the urge of contributing to the greater good and am easily intrigued by technological novelty.
