My interests lie in the broad topic of improving the modelling capability of Deep
Learning models, which refers to anything related to information and knowledge
representation, novel architectures and modelling paradigms, learnable causality and
reasoning, effective and efficient training methods, etc. This includes but is not
limited to topics such as Modularity, Multimodality , Representation Learning, and
Causal Deep Learning. I consider myself to be intellectually curious and would like to
dedicate my curiosity to good use.

% I consider myself an individual who is intellectually curious, passion-driven and eager to better himself. I have been working in AI/ML for 5 years, with a focus on Document Understanding. My work consists of both conducting research and developing solutions to suit the needs of clients. I also have 4 publications on Document Understanding. I'm looking for opportunities where I can stay current with the literature, develop and implement AI solutions that people enjoy using. Others finding my work useful gives me great satisfaction, thus an opensource lover like HuggingFace would be a dream company for me.
