\begin{xitemize}
    \item Building Document Intelligence technologies
    \begin{zitemize}
        \item Conducted researches, applied state-of-the-art methods to serve client projects.
        \item Co-authored 2 papers on Information Extraction.
        \item Worked on information extraction for visually-rich documents with limited data using language models, increased the f1-score by 0.2 - 0.7 on several client data sets.
        \item Worked on document-object detection and localization on images, over 0.85 IoU score achieved.
        \item Worked on document image classification, over 0.85 accuracy score achieved on a data set with 20+ classes.
        \item Worked on object detection on visually-rich documents, such as stamps and check marks.
        \item Worked on data synthesis/augmentation using image processing techniques for overcoming data shortage.
        \item Other problems worked on: Text segmentation, printed/handwriting OCR, handled AI flow on client projects, contributed to internal libraries.
        \item Collaborated with the BizDev team, facilitated alignment amongst RnD groups to develop business-oriented solutions.
    \end{zitemize}
    \item Internal data management system
    \begin{zitemize}
        \item Developed synchronization and local version control features for the CLI tool.
        \item Initiated and took charge of data standardization: making data from client projects be collectively re-useable for RnD purposes.
        \item Participated in system design and feature planning.
        \item Aligned requests and expectations of different user groups (RnD members and DataOps members).
