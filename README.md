Here lie my CV and its source.

I included the source so people can use it as a template, as I too created this using templates from others:
- https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/a-customised-curve-cv/mvmbhkwsnmwv
- https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/data-science-tech-resume-template/zcdmpfxrzjhv

Note: The font files are actually Font Awesome 6, I changed the name so it could work with the `fontawesome5` package.

If you found this helpful, a :star: would be appreciated.
